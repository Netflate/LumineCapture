// Optical character recognition.
//
// `OcrBackend` hides the engine: input `OcrImage`, output `OcrText`.
// implementation of new engine is a new module & one line in `default_backend`.
//
// layout   - detection boxes -> lines, blocks, reading order
// view     - selection over those lines
// runtime  - recognition on a worker thread
// models   - available, installed and selected models
// download - background download of models
// bidi     - converting visual RTL text order to logical order for copy/paste.
// daemon   - persistent process keeping a pre-ready model instance ready in memory. (crucial for gpu ocr, see below)
// settings - how to prepare the engine (on-demand / at-launch / daemon)

// clarifications: 
// Settings : 
// - on-demand : load the engine when choosing ocr 
// - at-launch : load the engine at app launch
// - daemon    : launches a background daemon, that outlives main process, which 
//               purpose is keeping ready ocr engine

// When specific mode is chosen and why: 
// first things to keep in mind: 
// * GPU initialization takes time, and decent chunk on memory (`1`)
// * Preparing engine for cpu takes around 90ms, and some memory (`2`)

// Default mode: on-demand.
// 1. why not at-launch: launching engine on every launch is inefficient, it's not something user will use on every launch
//  it will make sense to make a separate bind, that instantly launches the engines, and chooses ocr tool, but that's later

// 2. why not daemon: launching daemon for cpu is inefficient, running a separate daemon will gain practically nothing, only around
// 90 ms on my machine. Yet, for gpu there is real gain, gpu scan is much faster than cpu, and launching engine with gpu 
// takes much more time, so it makes sense for it to be in a daemon. Yet, daemon takes GPU memory, and having a background
// daemon with always 100+mb taken is not a good idea, sooo it's not optimal
